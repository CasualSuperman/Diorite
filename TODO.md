* ~~Finish set legality filters.~~
* Finish other filters.
* ~~Get a ban list/restricted list in a downloadable format.~~
    * ~~searchthecity.me can do this! We should probably set up a service to ping their data occassionally and host it locally, since they don't send modified headers.~~
	* Need to find a way to discover differences witohut saving lists. Use a hash of the payload, maybe?
* ~~Should rehost mtgjson.com's source before release.~~ (But give proper credit)
* Find a card price API?
* ~~Get a different db storage location for Windows (OSX too?) since it doesn't support the homedir method.~~
    * Confirm the storage locations for OSX and Windows are correct.
