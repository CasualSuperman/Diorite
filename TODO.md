* Figure out what kind of GUI we're using.
	* QML
	* GTK
	* QT
	* Web with embedded browser
* Get a ban list/restricted list in a downloadable format.
    * searchthecity.me can do this! We should probably set up a service to ping their data occassionally and host it locally, since they don't send modified headers.
* ~~Should rehost mtgjson.com's source before release.~~ (But give proper credit)
* Find a card price API?
* ~~Get a different db storage location for Windows (OSX too?) since it doesn't support the homedir method.~~
    * Confirm the storage locations for OSX and Windows are correct.
